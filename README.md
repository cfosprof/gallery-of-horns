An application that displays images and information of horned animals, allowing users to filter images by number of horns and chose their favorite image.



Today I learned about event.propogation, and how to create a div in within a div that allowed me to click the heart to increment favorites, and the image to activate modal. 

Number and name of feature: There is one feature, so I hope it was Display a Modal.

The didn't take long to implement, it was fixing all the issues that occured when I moved the majority of my application out of main and into app.js.

This is such a tough question. I don't know. It was 8AM Maybe?

Finish Time
Late.

Since I started most of these features before I knew they were a requirement its tough to gauge how much time was needed.
